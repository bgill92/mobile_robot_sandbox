{"id":"mobile_robot_sandbox-3v0","title":"Migrate from Docker-based workflow to pixi-based development","description":"**Context:**\nCurrently using Docker + docker-compose for development environment with:\n- ROS2 Humble base image\n- Multi-stage Dockerfile with development tools (clang, cmake, git, neovim, etc.)\n- Python dependencies (matplotlib, scipy) installed via pip\n- rosdep for ROS package dependencies\n- colcon for workspace building\n- X11 forwarding for Gazebo GUI\n- User permission mapping (UID/GID)\n- Build artifact caching (.colcon/build, install, log)\n\n**Goal:**\nReplace Docker workflow with pixi for faster, more reproducible development environment that:\n- Provides consistent environment across machines\n- Eliminates Docker build times\n- Simplifies dependency management\n- Maintains ROS2 Humble + Gazebo support\n- Preserves X11/GUI capabilities\n\n**Migration Tasks:**\n1. Create pixi.toml with:\n   - ROS2 Humble packages\n   - Gazebo Classic dependencies\n   - Development tools (clang, cmake, git, neovim, tmux, etc.)\n   - Python dependencies (matplotlib, scipy)\n   - colcon build system\n   \n2. Configure pixi environments:\n   - Default development environment\n   - Optional test/CI environment\n   \n3. Set up pixi tasks for common workflows:\n   - Build workspace (colcon build)\n   - Source setup\n   - Launch Gazebo simulations\n   - Run tests\n   \n4. Update documentation:\n   - Replace Docker instructions in README.md\n   - Add pixi installation guide\n   - Document new workflow commands\n   \n5. Handle ROS-specific considerations:\n   - rosdep integration for package.xml dependencies\n   - Workspace sourcing in pixi shell\n   - ROS_DOMAIN_ID and environment variables\n   \n6. Test migration:\n   - Verify Gazebo simulation launches\n   - Ensure colcon build works\n   - Validate X11 forwarding for GUI\n   - Test all existing launch files\n\n**Current Files to Replace/Remove:**\n- Dockerfile\n- compose.dev.yml\n- src/andino/docker/requirements.txt (if applicable)\n\n**Files to Create:**\n- pixi.toml\n- .pixi/ directory (gitignored)\n- Updated README.md with pixi instructions\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Can build ROS2 workspace using pixi\n- Gazebo simulation launches successfully\n- Development tools accessible\n- Simpler workflow than Docker (fewer commands)\n- Faster iteration time","status":"in_progress","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"bilal.gill@technipfmc.com","created_at":"2026-02-02T15:36:06.081759562-05:00","created_by":"Bilal Gill","updated_at":"2026-02-02T19:29:08.946017704-05:00"}
